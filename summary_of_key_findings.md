# Summary of key findings across studies
#### _Steve Yost_
The table below was generated by ChatGPT 4o after uploading the five papers. The prompts I gave were the following:
```
I've uploaded five papers. What can you find that's common to all the results? Do you see any interesting patterns?
```
It generated key findings in bullet list form for each study. I then prompted:
```
For future reference, please refer to
fgene-14-1054558.pdf as Dataset 1
fmars-07-00598.pdf as Dataset 2
fgene-12-795706.pdf as Dataset 3
1-s2.0-S0044848621004944-main.pdf as Dataset 4
1-s2.0-S1050464819311295-main.pdf as Dataset 5

Please create a table summarizing the key findings across studies, with the datasets in order in the column headings

## Caveat
I have not yet validated these summaries by re-examining the paper.
